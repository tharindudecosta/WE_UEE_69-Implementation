# AyuSri_Project

        AyuSri is a mobile application that specially develop for maintain the good health for everyone
        through the Sri Lankan Ayurweda medicines. Ayurveda medicine has a long history and can
        effectively cure any disease. And also, ayurveda medicines are 100% natural.
        Due to the economic crisis faced by Sri Lanka recently the economic condition of the people of
        the country has collapsed very badly. As a result of that people have fallen into such a difficult
        situation that they cannot even get medicine for a disease. Due to the economic crisis, the fees
        of the doctors as well as the medicines of western medicine have gone up. As a solution to this,
        our aim is to create a mobile application that solves people’s ailments by promoting local
        medicines. Then, if a person gets sick, they can easily find a solution from his own home. Through 
        it people’s health condition can be maintained well, and it helps to get rid of the economic 
        hardships that people have fallen into.
